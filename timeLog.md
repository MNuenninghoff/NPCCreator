I spent most of my time this week working on the Week-2 activity and watching the videos. I did continue
to refine my project idea. The Problem Statement was posted to Slack. I wrote some user stories for the 
project. I defined what qualities I want the program to generate for a base NPC template. I started thinking
about what screens the application will have.

This week, for the project I worked on getting everything set for checkpoint 1. I already had done most of the work
for the user stories and the problem statement, so mostly this consisted of polishing things up, drawing out 
screen designs, and writing out a project plan timeline.
Otherwise, I worked on the advent of code puzzle with JUnit and Log4J. I really like Log4J, I can tell it is 
going to be incredibly useful. I am still getting used to JUnit.
