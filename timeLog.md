I spent most of my time this week working on the Week-2 activity and watching the videos. I did continue
to refine my project idea. The Problem Statement was posted to Slack. I wrote some user stories for the 
project. I defined what qualities I want the program to generate for a base NPC template. I started thinking
about what screens the application will have.
