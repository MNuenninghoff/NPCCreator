# Problem Statement

As a DM, oftentimes, your party will wander off track. Ignoring the flashing neon signs saying “dragons and treasure this way”, they instead head off to the part of the map that you left blank with the thought, “I’ll fill that in next Friday”. Now you need to quickly make some NPCs to fill out the town that you are creating right now.

I want to build an application that can quickly generate randomized NPC templates to provide descriptions for busy DM’s. Need a barkeeper who has something a unique trait? Now you can quickly generate it (and save it for future reference). Struggling to come up with a fun villain for the next plot arc? Quickly make a couple random villains and see if any strike your fancy.

**The goal of this application is to streamline prep work and make NPC generation faster than rolling through random tables, as well as providing an interface to save NPC’s that you like.**
